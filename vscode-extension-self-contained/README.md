# NuSMV VSCode Plugin (Alpha 0.0.1)

This plugin provides syntax highlighting as well as semantic support for `.smv` filetypes.

Semantic checks will update on save. 

## Next release:
- Run configurations
- Semantic check trigger on text change rather than save.

# Notes

This extension uses the [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) integration for VS Code based on the Microsoft [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol).
